    <title>Functional documentation of Scala POI Wrapping Objects</title>
</head>
<body>
    <p>The main aim of the functional testing suite is to ensure that majority of the functionality offered by Apache POI (currently v3.9)
        is also available via SPOIWO library and in functional way.</p>
    <p>Therefore we document the code, by implementing Apache POI functionality from http://poi.apache.org/spreadsheet/quick-guide.html the SPOIWO way
        and compare the results with the original implementation.</p>
    <p>The following use cases have been documented:</p>
    <table>
        <tr><th>TestNumber</th><th>Test Description</th></tr>
        <tr><td>T001</td><td>How to create workbook and sheet</td></tr>
        <tr><td>T002</td><td>How to create cells</td></tr>
        <tr><td>T003</td><td>How to create date cells</td></tr>
        <tr><td>T004</td><td>Working with different types of cells</td></tr>
        <tr><td>T005</td><td>Aligning cells</td></tr>
