    <h2>Getting started with SPOIWO</h2>

    <h3>Adding SPOIWO library references to your project</h3>
    <p>Since SPOIWO is intended to support conversions to multiple spreadsheet-like formats (at the moment supports: XLSX, CSV and basic HTML)
        we made a decision to split the framework into a core model library and the number of independent nature libraries. This way users
        who (let's say) wish to benefit from SPOIWO support for CSV are not obliged to import the Apache POI libraries into their project.</p>

    <p>The downside of this decision is a necessity to explicitly specify all the number of libraries for all the spreadsheet natures in your
        project. Therefore in order to set up the SPOIWO functionality for both HTML and XLSX support you'd need to import the following JARs:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>spoiwo-core.jar</li>
        <li>spoiwo-nature-xlsx.jar</li>
        <li>spoiwo-nature-html.jar</li>
    </ol>



    <h3>Creating your first Excel spreadsheet with SPOIWO</h3>
    <p>In order to create a new spreadsheet using SPOIWO framework please follow the 3 simple steps:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Define spreadsheet model</li>



        <li>Add spreadsheet nature</li>
        <li>Apply conversion method</li>
    </ul>
